# Cam Profile Coordinate Generator for Catia
CATIA is great. But wouldn't it be even better if there was a way to automate the creation of cams in CATIA? This project aims to do just that.

Plan

1. Initial Matlab version...done
2. Python version...in progress
3. Standalone executable...queued

How to use Matlab Ver?
1. Fill in Template.xlsx
2. Run Gui.fig
3. Copy the generated coordinates in the coordinated.xlsx and use gsd spline technique to get it into CATIA.
